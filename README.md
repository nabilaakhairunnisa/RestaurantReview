This application is a platform where users can provide reviews for restaurants.

It utilizes data from the API available at the following [link](https://restaurant-api.dicoding.dev/#/)

Key features of this application include:

1. **ImageView**: Used to display images of restaurants.
2. **TextView**: Displays information such as restaurant names, descriptions, reviews, and more.
3. **TextInputLayout**: Provides an input field for users to enter their restaurant reviews.
4. **Button**: Allows users to submit their reviews.

The application employs ConstraintLayout and RecyclerView to present a list of restaurant reviews.

For data interaction, it utilizes the following methods:
- **POST**: To add review data, including name, date, and review, to the API.
